# 📊 Power BI Infinite Scroll Carousels & Retro Tickers

Welcome to my **Power BI Infinite Scroll & Ticker Pack** — a creative way to bring **dynamic scrolling content** into your reports using pure HTML + CSS **inside DAX measures**.

---

## ✅ **What’s inside**

- 👥 **Team Cards** — Meet your team with the `ScrollingTeamCard`.
- ⚽ **Football Stats** — Loop through player profiles with goals, assists, and more.
- 💼 **Sales Team Carousel** — Show top performers and their sales.
- 🌍 **Inflation Carousel** — Compare countries visually.
- 🛍️ **Product Carousel** — Highlight products and growth.
- 📈 **KPI Highlight Carousel** — Big key stats on loop.
- 📻 **Retro Radio Message Ticker** — 1980s broadcast style.
- 📺 **Ceefax Ticker** — BBC Ceefax blocky style.
- ⏱️ **SpeedControl Table** — Lets users pick scroll speed in a slicer.

---

## 🧩 **How it works**

- Each carousel or ticker is built with **HTML + CSS** wrapped inside a **DAX measure**.
- The `SpeedControl` table makes the speed dynamic.
- Use the **HTML Content Viewer** visual in Power BI to render the HTML.
- **Fully dynamic**, no JavaScript needed.

## ✨ **Original Inspiration**

These infinite scrolling ideas were inspired by [Temani Afif’s Infinite Scroll Animation](https://codepen.io/t_afif/pen/jOXRGGx) — I tidied the original idea and turned it into reusable DAX blocks and standalone HTML files.  
💡 *Thank you Temani for the brilliant base concept!*

## 🗂️ **Included Files**

✅ **`/html/scrolling-team-cards.html`** — A standalone version of the infinite scroll, fully commented, great for learning or tweaking.

✅ **`/measures/`** — Each DAX measure with clear `/* */` comments so you know how it works.

✅ **`SpeedControlTable.txt`** — A `DATATABLE` you can paste into Power BI to power the speed slicer.

## 💡 **How to use it**

1. Import the `SpeedControl` table into your model.
2. Paste the DAX measure into Power BI.
3. Use an **HTML Content Viewer** visual to render the HTML.
4. Add a slicer for scroll speed.
5. Enjoy your infinite loop on office screens, dashboards, or even waiting rooms!
